# foo.bar

## About
This repository contains solution for level 1-5 Google foo.bar challenge by Muhammad Ikhsan using Java programming language. The Google foo.bar challenge itself contains several problems related to computer science and its principles in solving real world cases.

## Problem-solving details
The problems consists of 5 different levels that are increasing in difficulty. The details of the challenge elaborated below:
- Problem 1 (level 1) `array accessing` `ad-hoc` `indexing`: <br>
The easiest problems. The tasks was to convert text into braille code.

- Problem 2 (level 2) `math` `ad-hoc`: <br>
Math problems (about configuration of pegs) related to linear equations but it can be simplified into `O(1)` algorithm.

- Problem 3 (level 2) `math` `ad-hoc`: <br>
Math problems (about configuration of pegs) related to linear equations but it can be simplified into `O(1)` algorithm.

- Problem 4 (level 3) `math` `ad-hoc`: <br>
Math problems (about configuration of pegs) related to linear equations but it can be simplified into `O(1)` algorithm.

- Problem 5 (level 3) `math` `ad-hoc`: <br>
Math problems (about configuration of pegs) related to linear equations but it can be simplified into `O(1)` algorithm.

- Problem 6 (level 3) `math` `ad-hoc`: <br>

- Problem 9 (level 5) `math` `ad-hoc`: <br>
Math problems (about configuration of pegs) related to linear equations but it can be simplified into `O(1)` algorithm.

## Finished State
It is said that Google foo.bar is part of Google hiring recruitment, but unfortunately since 2020, it is not used anymore.
